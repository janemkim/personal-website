# Jane's website repo

I started this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Terminal commands for project

- `npm start` - runs the website in dev mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm test` - runs tests in the interactive watch mode
- `npm run build` - builds production site to the `build` folder
